0,"Fine book, Worth the money!",Helpful for the beginners who are starting data visualization or R-Course But not so much for advanced studies or projects. Good Cover and Fine Printing with smooth pages.Overall Worth the money but only for beginners.
1,Black and white only,Book cover and paper quality is okay. Package is good. Buy only if u have R basic knowledge.
2,If R is Ferrari of Data science world then this book is Nut and Bolt manual to cary out routine but critical operations on data,"Firstly understand that this book does not cover most of models, algorithms etc. It actually covers all the steps that you need to perform on ""real life"" data to get it ready to run your models. It does not teach about K-means, regression, bagging and boosting etc. For that you can use James,Witten,Hastie,Tibshirani's excellent ""Introduction to Statistical Learning"" book. But this Wikham book fills a critical void.In my personal experience it takes more than 90% time to get the data in a shape where you think it is now ready for you to run your algorithms. This is far cry from the sterile,cleaned up  data sets used in the data science courses. The real life data is very messy. This book is clearly written for the practitioners who deal with real life situations. This book helped me a lot to get my data in proper form. which includes joining two disparate data-sets based on keys,  creating new derivative columns based on existing columns, remove unwanted feature set, take care of all those NAs, filter the rows on criteria, perform different aggregate functions (mean, sum, median etc) date wise or factor wise. It also covers bit of ggplot basics so you can start plotting the data from the word go. This book uses the tidyverse family packages (especially dplyr) written by the same author. ggplot is also written by Wikham. Both packages contain functions that can improve your productivity 10x. Both have now become  de facto packages used by most R data scientists.This book immensely helped me perform data analysis on my messy data. It taught me what and how to perform necessary operations on my data using very useful functions in dplyr package which is part of tidyverse family.R is very powerful environment for data analysis. I would call it Ferrari of data science world. But although very powerful, it has its own quirks and learning curve, even for experienced programmers. The packages like dplyr, caret, ggplot make your life easier and allow you to fully harness the horse power of R."
3,Highly recommended,"The author has taken a good approach.  Instead of giving you the introduction or much theory, author teaches each concept with examples.  You start with coding immediately which actually better.  Exercise is also very good.Those who have just started R just like me, I highly recommend it.  You will be fully engaged with coding and not get bored."
4,Suitable for Data analyst,Go for it. learn it
5,Your gateway to data science,"It is hard to pick a good introductory data science book these days since there are too many out there. But R for Data Science is arguably one of the best books you can pick and start your data science journey. If you go through this whole book, not only you will learn fundamentals of data science but also advanced data management tools that will allow you to analyze a variety of data. Some introduction to R language is required which can be picked up from first few chapters of Art of R Programming by Norman Matloff."
6,"Amazing book, but horrible condition","Wonderful book for beginners. R programming is entirely new for me , this book full fills my needs, very good , easy to understand with examples and exercises  for practice perfect The condition of the book looks kind of old , the front cover is not good."
7,R basics for data analysis,Good for the price.
8,A must have for anyone who loves R,It is really helpful to have it by your side no matter how proficient in R you are.
9,Good book to have for learning R,Really good book to learn the ropes in R... must haves for anyone just starting off with R... It's structured and has good amount of practice questions
10,Great book. A must buy,This book is extremely handy book for those who already have basic understanding of R. A great collection of thoery and code to use packages to boost the features of R
11,Bad paper quality,Content of the book is great while the paper quality feels like it has been photostated and bound. Doesn't do justice for the price tag
12,Must have for a R beiginner,Very useful if you are starting data science journey using R.
13,Four Stars,Excellent book for beginners. Hadley Wickham's tidyverse is simple and intuitive.
14,Only for beginners.,Buy this only if you are getting started with Programming in R & are not taking any other classes for it. I have intermediate proficiency in R & I did not find this book that useful.
15,Good book for beginners,Good book for beginners
16,Four Stars,Very nice
17,Five Stars,Excellent book
18,Old product,
19,Pirated copy!,"Got a pirated copy, book is awesome but was not expecting a pirated copy. Not sure if price is worth pirated book."
20,Quality - Locally printed,Quality of the physical book was not good.
21,Not for beginners,"Not for beginners... Also price is just too high. Content in book doesn't justify the price. R is not a rocket science, you can easily get a great material on the internet without spending any money."
22,"The book is good, however the drawback is","prompt delivery from amazon..The book is good, however the drawback is, all the graphs/charts are in black and white. so when the authors refers a particular color line in a graph/chart, we can not distinguish between the lines/objects given in the graph/chart.."
23,Good overview of R,Well written book with good examples and code which covers both the why and how of R and many useful  R packages.
24,Buen libro para explicar conceptos de datos en R,"Buenas explicaciones de los conceptos de ciencia de datos cuando se usa R, útil como ayuda para el aprendizaje y referencia futura"
25,Good introduction to R,Although my apprenticeship has free on-line books I like a physical book so you can flip back and fore. It is important you practice with R Studio but this book is well written and a pleasant read. Please note there is a new edition August 2023 so it might be worth waiting.
26,Great Book for R newbie’s,Used it for my coding project in R and am quite happy with the content and teaching methods!
27,“R for Data Science”  is an exceptional book for Data Scientists.,"The authors, Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, are probably among the greatest authorities in their field. An important part of the book is devoted to the Tidyverse collection of packages for R. Once one has mastered the basics of the R language this book greatly enhances the capability of what one can do in this language, coupled to the Tidyverse language. In my opinion this book is the logical continuation of one’s learning experience once one has learned R. O’Reilly, the publisher of this book has lavished beautiful illustrations that facilitates greatly the comprehension of the clearly written text. A veritable pleasure to see such typographical masterpiece."
28,R for Data Science,The book is Ok!Thanks!
29,"If you want to learn R, buy this book!",This is tied as my favorite tech/programming book to date. The organization is well thought out. The support materials are exactly where they should be. The author and publisher are easy to contact if necessary. The material is also very engaging unlike many beginner books.This book will give you all the skills necessary to start doing real work and to move on to more specialized skills.
30,R vitaminado,"No cabe duda de que Hadley Wickham es el rey del rock en lo que a R y RStudio se refiere, de modo que estamos de suerte al poder estudiar un libro coescrito por él y Garrett Grolemund en que se nos pone al corriente sobre una nueva forma de escribir código en R basada en la suite tidyverse, un súper-paquete formado por otros paquetes, de entre los cuales destaca, como la joya de la corona, ggplot2 para dibujar gráficos de alta calidad.Además, nuestra suerte se multiplica al saber que Wickham y Grolemund han tenido el detallazo de permitir el acceso gratuito en la Web a su libro (en PDF) y al código que lo acompaña. De modo que el que quiera puede leer el Nuevo Testamento del programa R sin gastarse un duro. El Antiguo Testamento, la forma tradicional de programar en R, sigue vigente, desde luego, para quien así lo desee, pero no está de más conocer la buena nueva que nos traen Wickham y Grolemund porque indiscutiblemente mejora algunos aspectos del software R.Debe quedar claro que éste no es un libro para aprender estadística con R (sólo en el apartado 4, dedicado a la modelización, hay un tenue contacto con la estadística, pero sólo se araña la superficie del asunto), sino más bien un libro para familiarizarse con el manejo de R de una forma mejorada.La obra de Wickham y Grolemund tiene por objeto enseñarnos a importar datos, ordenarlos, entenderlos (mediante modelización, transformación y visualización) y comunicar los resultados. Pero los autores no tienen un pelo de tontos y comienzan y acaban el texto con las partes más entretenidas de este proceso: la visualización (con ggplot2) y la comunicación (mediante R Markdown). Dejando las regiones más áridas entremedias. Confieso, a este respecto, que me ha resultado especialmente aburrido el tratamiento de las fechas con el paquete lubridate, escrito por Grolemund.En fin, un libro de lectura indispensable para quien quiera manejar R con solidez pero no igual de ameno en todo su recorrido."
31,learning R,"As a beginner to R, I bought this book at the recommendation from Data Science for Fundraising: Build Data-Driven Solutions Using R and am so glad that I did. R4DS provides useful content to get started with R. The book consists of 5 main sections:1. Getting started (Explore)2. Data manipulation (Wrangle)3. Scripting (Program)4. Build models5. Presenting information (Communicate)Here’s a brief overview of each section:ExploreI was a bit puzzled as the book jumps directly into plotting using the ggplot library. Although the authors are clear that the purpose of introducing ggplot is to keep our motivation high, seeing the ggplot syntax without a whole lot of background can be confusing at first. But then the authors do a great job at explaining the various aspects of ggplot. So my advice to other R beginners is to just keep going forward!After the intro to ggplot, you learn about the basics of R, such as variables and functions, as well as intermediate topics such as writing scripts, manipulating data using dplyr, and lastly EDA. This section ends with a good overview of how to use RStudio to saves script files.WrangleThis section starts with an intro to tibbles, which is a new concept for handling data in R. This section is important since most of the functions in later chapters use tibbles, such as reading data from various sources. There are many important concepts that seem useful such as “tidying up” your data and cleaning data points (string and dates).ProgramThis is a function section that introduces data pipes. This section explores how to chain complicated data operations together. You also get to see some good practice in writing human readable code. Then the book jumps into using the power of R as a functional programming language. Once I feel more proficient, I will take a deeper look at purr.ModelNow, depending on your situation, you may not be interested in this section, which is focuses on predictive modeling. There are quite a few recipes that explore “why” questions. Definitely planning to come back to this chapter later.CommunicateThis section is useful because it introduces how to create reusablereports.Overall, this is my go-to book along with the book I previously mentioned. This book is a solid reference book for learning R. Another good thing is that the companion website is regularly updated and you can copy and paste the code examples directly into RStudio. I’m looking forward to further exploring R and learning how to create my own data visualizations."
32,"Great book for R, RStudio, and learning about data","Thank you Hadley Wickham and the RStudio team for making data analysis so much easier!As a graduate student this book provided me with a foundation for using R and Rstudio using the tidyverse package. It makes you a generalist in R where you can do most things afterwards. It could take a few months with meaningful projects on hand to get the hang of most things. The writers are good teachers as they take you through the nicely structured concepts without confusing or overwhelming you. If you know a little you can enter different chapters without necessarily knowing the previous ones. The book exposes you to a lot of snippets of good workflows and you learn how to do things the right way. You also see what is possible generally and this seeds new ideas in one's head. Most of the best practices you learn can be taken to other languages and workflows as well. Learning R and data analysis this way will not only let you be a good data analyst but but it also prepares you to navigate any programming language with the foundation and framework for understanding data you get here. You can always combine R with another language where you think R, and the tidyverse package in particular, will get the job done better.This book is available online for free but I bought the physical copy as I wanted to read it seriously from cover to cover. In 6 months I have read about 1/2 to all the content in each chapter of the book and used its code in my own workflow. I started using R sporadically for the first time two years prior and Rstudio two months prior to purchasing this book.In the end the book has become my go to for learning and coding, as a learning tool and a handy reference. I use it with the Oxford Handbook of Medical Statistics by Peacock, Janet L. for statistical methods and the STDHA website for other sample workflows and codes."
33,An excellent introduction to using R for Exploratory Analysis.,"Wickham and Grolemund have produced an excellent book that would help a beginning R user become very efficient in explanatory analysis. Unsurprisingly the approach that they expound utilises the ""hadleyverse"" a collection of packages (ggplot2 for visualisation, tidyr for reshaping, dplyr for selecting and filtering, purrr for functional programming, broom for linear models etc) that dramatically speed up most of the common steps involved in an analysis. One benefit of Wickham's involvement in these packages has been a coherent philosophy that sits behind them. It can be a little tricky when learning this philosophy, but the long term benefits are enormous.The book is broken up into a number of sections that effectively builds up the ability to ingest, transform, visualise and model datasets. A good portion of the book is available in an online version, to give you a taste of how it is written. Many have been following it as it was written. I have passed on copies of the book to a number of colleagues who were just starting out and the response has been uniformly positive. In my own case I was familiar with some of the these packages; ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, but found the book taught me purrr and how to better use the packages together.Probably my two biggest caveats to readers are that there are situations where packages from outside the ""hadleyverse"" maybe required. The authors do a great job of pointing this out, but it does pay in my experience to know data.table and lattice for example. Both because they can occasionally fit a problem better but also because you inevitably come across other people's code where these packages are used. The other caveat is that the modelling is a little rudimentary. Most of the examples are just fitting independent regression models, whereas it seems to me that a hierarchical model would be a better fit. Still these are small things and it would be silly to expect a single book to cover all of these areas.In short this is the book I would give to someone who was keen to learn about how to use R for data science. It reads really well building up the different components whilst still being a valuable reference if you just need a reminder of a particular package (what is the difference between tibbles and data frames again?). Even though a good portion of the book is available online, it is well worth it to have the full thing on your bookshelf (digital or otherwise). On a broader note with Max Kuhn (author of the excellent ""Applied Predictive Modelling"" with Kjell Johnson) joining Wickham and Grolemund at RStudio, it is a great time to start your R journey."
34,Elaborazione dei dati e modelling,"Un libro di estremo valore per il suo contenuto. Didattico, sintetico, efficace. Un piccolo capolavoro, come del resto Tidyverse."
35,"Good content, but print quality is so-so","To anyone who may be unaware, all of the contents of the book are available for free online and are updated regularly. I purchased this book in October 2019 and it was already out of date compared the the version online. However, not enough out of date to deter me from using it.I prefer to read books in print versus online, which is the main reason I purchased this book. It also allows me to study while on a plane, which is very convenient. The book is great, easy to understand, and provides a lot of questions and examples to work through in each chapter.I’m halfway through the book now, and one complaint that I have is that the quality of the print leaves a bit to be desired. If you look at my photos, you’ll see that I drew boxes around certain words/letters. I had to do this because the printed lines were SO faint that I completely missed it the first time I read it. This made the chapter more confusing than it should have been. I had to reread it a few times before I made out the super faint boxes. I compared it to the online version, which had the lines/boxes clearly drawn. I also wish the solutions to the practice questions and exercises were printed in the book so that I could check my answers. However, the answers are available online...it just adds a bit of unnecessary hassle. Those are really my only complaints so far.Overall, good book for beginner R and data science learners."
36,Great book - Very useful!,"I am very happy with this book.  Its easy to read and the exercises/code work and are applicable.  The text is clearly written and the supporting graphics are well constructed.  I have started working through some of the exercises in R and find them very helpful.  I bought this book after completing a graduate course in data analysis using R.  Much of the course was constructed around Hadley Wickham's work.  We used ggplot2 and tidyverse extensively.  We did not use this book in the course and I now wish we had used it as a desk reference.  This book is answering many of the questions I had.  It is also providing an overview of many basic concepts and tools in R and would have been helpful to have at my fingertips during my graduate course.  Google is a great resource, but a well written and easily sourced desktop resource like this is indispensable.  I am learning something new about R constantly...I would consider myself a late beginner to early intermediate user of R for data science/data analysis.  I often find books that cover the basics extremely useful, because its easy to forget.  So for me, this was a good buy - regardless of my skill level.  Others will have to make their own decision.  This book does not cover mapping in R.  In fact, there is a sentence in Chapter 1 that states - this book does not cover mapping.  I would like to have had more on that topic or a follow-up book committed to mapping and integration with other tools like Leaflet or ArcGIS."
37,Some good material mixed with some rushed explanations and a lack of sufficient examples,"I'll preface this review by saying that while I think this book has some significant problems, R seems to be much harder to find good tutorials for than any other programming language or computer topic I've ever learned (I've been a programmer for 15+ years).  I tried a Udacity course on R which ended up being so shallow that I feel like I learned more about R from 20 pages of this book than from hours of Udacity videos.  While I am becoming proficient in R from this book, I think that this book has some problems that have made it slower and more difficult for me to learn R.With the exception of the final few chapters, R for Data Science is informative and easy to understand during its explanation of R concepts and commands.  The biggest problem that I have with this book is with the exercises in each chapter.  Essentially, each chapter shows you to use a hammer, how to use a screwdriver, and how to use a saw, and then says build a birdhouse.  Building a birdhouse is more complex than using a hammer or a saw in isolation, and you may also need additional tools (such as a tape measure), which were never described in the chapter.  It would be much easier to figure out how to build a complete birdhouse if the book first showed how to build smaller scale projects, such as a small wooden box, rather than only showing how to use each tool mostly in isolation.  In that way, you'd get some examples of using tools together to construct something more complicated.Each topic has a few simple exercises, and also two or three exercises which are considerably more complicated than anything which was demonstrated earlier.  While I can figure out the solution eventually, I bought this book so that I can learn R as painlessly as possible.  It's frustrating to spend so much time trying to figure out a problem which I could have figured out much faster had I been give some better examples prior to the exercises.  Furthermore, no answers are given in the back of the book and there are sometimes exercises where a necessary command hasn't been shown in the book (I found a page online where another person had solved the exercises).In addition to the above problems, the last few chapters about formulas and modelling seem rushed and some concepts are poorly explained or barely explained at all (even though those concepts are used in the examples).This book will teach you enough about R to be manipulate and graph datasets and write some simple functions, although it may not give you enough information by itself to solve more complicated problems.  Once you start getting beyond dataset manipulation, modelling, and writing simple functions, you'll probably need another book to sufficiently understand those more advanced concepts."
38,Stopped Reading the Book Halfway into 1st Chapter,"I got through the Preface and about 60% of the first chapter and had to stopped.Before I get into the review to explain why I had to stop reading the book, it is important to note that this book is available online for free. I prefer print over screen, when possible. But if you don’t have a preference, just use that.Why did I put this book down midway through Chapter 1?Cascade of events that started w/ me requiring solutions to practice problems that are in the book.The only way to learn math and software development is by doing. Books on these subjects should ALWAYS contain exercise problems and solutions to those problems, either at the end of the chapter or by way of an appendix at the end of the book.The best solutions that I found are at jrnold's github page. I quickly noticed, however, that the answers posted on that site didn't quite fit the exercises in the book. When comparing the online version to the printed version (book), I noticed that exercises from the book had been reworded or completely dropped. So from the beginning of this year, when this book was published and released for sale, to this summer, it is apparent that many errors had been found and revisions needed to be implemented.There were so many differences between the online version and the book that I decided to stop reading the book in lieu of the online version.My 5-star Rating:The author does an excellent job explaining topics. He is very knowledgeable and it shows. With the amount of revisions in such a short time, however, I can't help but think that this book was rushed.But if I am stopped reading the book b/c of errors, why 5 stars? The book, by itself, might have gotten a 1-star review from me, but I am still going to learn from this author. The online version costs him/someone to keep up-to-date. Purchasing the book is an easy (and very fair) way to support this project."
39,"Muy buen libro, lo recomiendo.","Muy buen libro, lo recomiendo."
40,Best book for learning the R language,"Great book! I tried some other (cheaper) books while attempting to learn the R language. They were hard to focus on and follow. This book is the opposite. It progresses in a manner that makes sense, and doesn't force you to drudge your way through the boring stuff before learning anything useful. Plenty of practice and examples to help solidify what it teaches you."
41,This might be the best (NON-Fluff) Data Analysis book out there,"I think this book is a perfect blend of technical training, visual reporting, sample datasets and clear communication.  The authors teach concepts in small chunks of code, and the code is pretty easy to interpretI will also be honest, it took me a few months of playing with “R” to get to a point where the syntax made sense(im still learning).  Im at the point, where i can read each chapter and im NOT getting confused at any of the topics(through chapters 1-5 so far).Im really starting to feel confident enough to take the breakthroughs to develop solutions that will be able to use at work very soon(maybe in a month or so)I had invested several years into Python and its great but my company locks python down but leaves R completely open (probably concerning the kernal access).  So i had to switch to R from scratch.  The transition was intimidating at first, but i plugged away and got the basics on my own.  Now im somewhat confident about subsetting, db connections, dataframes, ggplot and dplyr.  Im looking forward to defining functions and proc+packages in the near future.I really have to commend Hadley and the Grolemund for putting together a VERY DIGESTIBLE book.  The book is long, but it is easy to follow.I bought the physical copy and im so happy, i bought the digital copy(hard to find)Thanks,Chris Buck"
42,"Great, easy-to-follow book for mastering how to work in R","If you are going to be using R extensively, you'll want to dive into this book and get yourself set up to work efficiently and quickly in R.  It covers all the things you need to know about working in R and RStudio EXCEPT for the stats and analysis part.  You learn about getting data in, cleaning the data up (because who is ever given a clean dataset to start with?), exploring and organizing your data, a quick primer on ggplot2 (you'll want the "
43,One of the best books to learn R,"This is one of the greatest books if you want to learn using r and rStudio. You learn by doing, learn by writing code. And then there are some exercises that you have to do yourself and they aren't easy. You have to think about everything you have learned so far to find your answer, but the satisfaction you get from doing it is just great. Oh and eclectic version of this book is free on the website and it is updated quite regularly. I have bought the book to support the author. Trust me you will learn from this book, all you have is to do all the exercises that you find in it."
44,"Good, but available free online.","So far this books is a clear explanation of the T language. What spoilt it ofr me is finding out that the entire thing is available online for free. Wish I'd known that before! Obviously, offline reading is great, but as these kind of books work best when you are doing the exercises whilst reading, the online method would suit most people better."
45,"Great book, but beginners beware","It's a great book to learn at your own pace the basics of data science and data manipulation with R, and I would recommend to anyone to buy it. The authors are precise and clear in the explanations.Just one comment: if you are a beginner with the language, you will have a harsh time going through the book. In the first 2 sections, where the authors explain ggplot and dplyr, if you don't know the grammar of the code you will certainly get frustrated because there is no explanation of the basics. They just start with the ggplot code and take off. The same occurs with the  dplyr chapter. They teach you how to use the functions filter(), arrang() and so on, but don't show you the basics of R.My advice is to read other sources to get a basic understanding of R and its grammar, and then get this book.Also I would like to point out that the printed version has some serious typos, missing graphs, incomplete diagrams and some datasets are not fully printed on the page, so sometimes the authors try to show you something on a new variable added to the original dataset, but it doesn't appear on the page,,,,"
46,Learn R the Right Way,"As a college student trying to learn R without any programming background, I often found the materials suggested by professors to be confusing and boring. I tried online courses, textbooks, and video tutorials, but still struggled to grasp important concepts. Finally, at the recommendation of a potential employer I gave Wickham's R for Data Science a try. He strongly recommended the book for both beginners, as well as intermediate R users looking to sharpen their skills.Unlike other books I had used previously, Wickham's explanations were concise, clear, and interesting. He teaches important fundamentals of the language, without overwhelming newcomers to R. Wickham's explanations are always accessible, even for those without programming experience.Hadley Wickham is practically a celebrity in the R community, and for good reason. He has developed many of the best packages in use. And unlike many experts, he is very conscious about teaching in a way that anyone can understand. Before you give up on learning R, I would definitely recommend giving this book a try.Note: The book is available for free on the author's website. However, I prefer to have a physical copy and have been pleased with the quality."
47,Codd ai tempi di RStudio,"Ho letto il libro dalla prima all'ultima parola.Quello che mi è piaciuto di più è il concetto di grammatica nella scienza dei dati: trovare quelle poche operazioni di base per eseguire tutto il resto. Questo è abbastanza vicino a quello che Edgar F. Codd ha fatto con l'algebra relazionale quasi 50 anni fa. Avrei voluto saperne di più su questo parallelismo.Nonostante il libro sia pensato per i nuovi arrivati, alcune parti sono piuttosto difficili (almeno per la mia esperienza). Sono rimasto incartato più di un giorno al capitolo 18. Questa parte è un po' troppo affrettata, in particolare perché i concetti di regressione lineare (e altri modelli) sono molto più profondi di quelli di filtrare un dataframe o di leggere un file dal disco. Inoltre, è un peccato che non esistono soluzioni per gli esercizi proposti.I capitoli che ho apprezzato di più sono 17 (Iteration with purr) e 20 (Many models with purr), dove viene magnificata tutta la potenza della combinazione di grammatiche e programmazione. L'esempio del gapminder è quasi poesia e di quella buona. Inoltre, il piccolo coniglietto Foo Foo raccontato con le pipes (capitolo 14) è un meraviglioso racconto.Tutto sommato mi è piaciuto questo libro e sono felice di usarlo per insegnare."
48,Very good!,"Book brings a lot of concepts and well written code. It also brings analysis of the results , helping you to improve your analysis skills. Good addition to my library"
49,This is a solid book and I am glad I purchased it,"This is a solid book and I am glad I purchased it. That said, the book is not for the novice. I think it's most useful to people who have had an exposure to R or at least programming. I am a novice to the programming world (although with good experience in statistics using stats applications like SPSS and some basic syntax writing experience),  and I found that while certain parts of the books were helpful,  others moved very fast and completely over my head, without the sufficient detail or an explanation that I could dig my teeth into. The exercises were not terribly helpful at cementing the knowledge either: many are far more complex than the chapter itself (and no answers that I could find in the book--although I found the answers online).  However, I don't know that there really are any solid guides written for the novice R user trying to learn data science, so this may still be the best of the bunch. In addition to reading this book, expect to be taking online courses on R and watching YouTube videos when you are stuck on a specific question."
50,Best way to learn data manipulation and creating graphs in R,"I think this is the best book to learn R for data science, it clearly teaches what it claims it will teach. In particular, it is a very strong book to learn how to manipulate data and create nice plots in R. The only place where I think it can improve is in relation to R Markdown, the treatment of that package is very shallow and it is even shallower in terms of some other packages such as shiny and web pages. Of course, now we have the book by Xie et al. 2019 R Markdown the definitive guide. If you do not know R and you are just learning a computer language then I recommend starting with Grolemund's book Hands-On Programming With R, then with this one."
51,Very basic,This book is mostly about ggplot2 and not the core language
52,Good practical book,"This book orders things differently than conventional R courses. It doesn't begin with introducing the basics, but with plotting graphs, which is what most beginners need R for. It is therefore good for people who need to get into the practical aspects of R quickly due to job demands. And in a way it puts off beginners less, because the basics are somewhat boring.However, it's a bit like learning conversation before learning grammar... Very quickly one realizes the importance of the basics. So I personally would combine this book with other conventional R courses to learn the language properly."
53,"Excellent book for explaining some of the underlying logic behind the tidyverse and gglplot, etc","I did a few online courses before reading this book, but that worked quite well as it meant to was revising some of what I knew while also learning a few new things per chapter"
54,Must-have for data scientists,"This book is an absolute must-have if you spend your days cleaning and analysing big datasets. I have had this book for a little over 4 months now and I use it almost every day as a part of my masters degree. I have found it is in a nice logical order and my data cleaning and analysis experience has flowed nicely by following the steps here.Sure, you could find the information in this book on Google, but that can be an overwhelming experience if you’re just starting out with data analysis and trying to learn tidyverse and other essential packages. This book is in a very understandable language for beginners and novice R users and beyond, and something to keep at hand at all times."
55,"Content OK, Book binding poor","I'm disappointed in the quality of the book binding.  The first day I opened this new book, a page fell out. The paperback book has a glued binding, but it's not holding the pages securely.  I want to start using R now and I don't want to wait to return the book.  I will think twice about buying an O'Reilly published book again.  I gave it 3 stars because the content looks good."
56,R for Data Science,"Mit ""R for Data Science"" besitzt man ein wirklich sehr anspruchsvolles Buch, welches sich detailliert mit den analytischen Konzepten der Programmiersprache R auseinandersetzt.Wichtig hier ist, dass das Buch gewissen Grundlagen voraussetzt, und es somit kein Einsteigerbuch ist. Das merkt man auch am Schreibstil des Buches.Das Buch selbst ist leider etwas klobig, hier ist die <b>kostenfreie</b> Online Version von Vorteil, da sie einen wirklich guten Überblick bietet und zudem auch noch ein Lösungsbuch hat.Der Aufbau selbst ist nicht einfach Kapitel zu Kapitel, sondern hier haben sich die Autoren was einfallen lassen und es wird anhand verschiedener Beispiele (zB. Datensatz Diamonds, NYC Flights) erklärt, wie man vorzugehen hat.Empfohlen für jeden, der bereits mit Programmiersprachen wie ua. Python (Pandas), MatLab oä. Erfahrungen gesammelt hat, und seinen Wissensstand im Bereich R nun erweitern möchte (natürlich in Bezug auf analytische Projekte)."
57,Masterpiece,"This book is about data exploration in R. It’s about importing data, tidying it, transforming it, visualizing it, modelling it (very small coverage) and communicating it.It’s the building block in Data Science to get your data in a way that you can visualize it, run statistical analytics or Machine Learning algorithms.In my view, there’s no competition in the Python world. Yes, there’s “Python for Data Analysis” or “Python Data Science Handbook” which are both written by super-smart people. But I feel like “R for Data Science” is much clearer written (and I love Pandas!)."
58,Good introduction and has useful tips,"This is a good introduction to R but new users should know that there is an emphasis on packages in the tidyverse. This has advantages in that some things like ggplot are much easier to use for graphing for a newbie than other approaches in R for graphing. The book has some examples and these are fun to work through but in some cases I found that I couldn't find some of the practice data sets referenced in the text. Still I think this is a useful text, there is a free online version of the book--did not know this when purchasing--so if you don't mind reading off a screen you can skip buying it and just use the free version."
59,Es la biblia de R; voy empezando pero esta muy completo … vale mucho la pena,R junto con Python son en mi opinión los 2 lenguajes que no deben faltar para aprender ciencias de datos . Voy comenzando a aprender R y el libro me está ayudando mucho . Lo recomiendo 100%
60,Some of the best R teaching available.,"I can only speak as a relative novice, but this is as fine a book as can be written on the subject for the novice, and I reckon that even intermediate level R users would profit from it. Wickham and Grolemund write with clarity, and instill not just the ""rules of the game,"" but also how to troubleshoot and think strategically about R coding for data science. While I prefer to read something for the first time on paper, the updated text is available online, and makes a remarkably efficient companion: I often copy code straight from the text and experiment with it in RStudio as I work my way through the book. Well written instructive texts of this type are rare and teach both the subject and ""learning how to learn"" the subject.I'm grateful to Wickham and Grolemund for crafting such a gem."
61,"How to Navigate the R Universe by Making Your Data ""Tidy""","This book is available in its latest version as a free online resource whether you buy this book or not. However if you are someone who likes to have an actual book in your hands then is the way to go. As you work through the examples you will find some errors where the R-code does not match the output presented. However, as this is a teaching book, you can look upon these small detective tasks as part of your learning process. If all else fails you can generally find the correct code in the updated online version. Make sure you write in the corrections as you find them to prevent frustration in the future.This book explains some of Hadley Wickham's initiatives to bring ""tidiness"" to the fairly chaotic universe which new R-coders must navigate."
62,The (current) best overview of the Tidyverse for data science,"The main reason you would buy this book is to get introduced to the ""tidy"" way of doing data science in R - in particular, learning about the many packages the Tidyverse has to offer for data visualization, processing, string manipulation, modeling, etc. You could probably do equally as well doing DataCamp courses on similar topics, so it's up to you to decide what's best for your learning style.Caveat: Not for beginners. Wickham assumes more comfort jumping into R than most programming newbies will have. Ideal if you have some experience with any programming language (not a lot, maybe just an intro class' worth) and have seen a little bit of R already."
63,Great book. I bought the hard copy even though I can read it online for free,"I like to mark up books that I use intensively, so it was worth it to me to buy the hard copy. I am thinkig of using it as a supplemental text in a data mining course. It covers all the manipulation steps before you run a DM algorithm. These strewps  are important, difficult, time consuming, and often tedious. There is only a little discussion of what or why to manipulate the data, but it has solid examples and discussion of HOW.  By the way, I only own 4 or 5 R books. This is good enough to be one of them. If it had come out a few years ago, I might have skipped one of my earlier purchases."
64,Good Beginner Text,"This is a good book for someone just getting started with R and Data Science.  The book is straightforward with nothing too complicated.  Covers the essentials, including data wrangling, visualizations, modeling and communication of results.  All the packages needed for the examples are the stand-by's, like ggplot2, dplyr, etc.  There is certainly more to R than provided by the book, but for that, one should check out Advanced R, also by Hadley Wickham.  I did like that the book counter-intuitively began with visualizations, which is usually after basic programming in other R books.  I appreciated the insight that many business user's may come to R for the visualizations, but maybe are scared away by the scripting.  This book attempts to help the reader get over those fears and get to using R quickly."
65,One of the Best R Resources,"Practical way to approach learning data wrangling and manipulation in R. Writing is easy to read and doesn’t get bogged down in coder’s jargon. Used this to teach myself how to handle my thesis data in R. I appreciated the book’s structure which starts light on several topics, leaves them, and comes back to dive into more detail. However, I ended up flipping from section to section to figure out my specific needs. I also appreciated the authors talked about the overall workflow in R, previous classes and online resources can be too specific and forget to teach efficient ways to manage files and projects."
66,Useful book for especially for data visualization,"Useful book for especially for data visualization.  They give you a good trunk of knowledge in the ggplot2, tidyverse, and modelr packages.  Would recommend for anyone starting out.  Learning how to manipulate data is a huge and often underrated part of machine learning, is useful and will be useful until the end of time or until data takes on a different form.  Learning how to set up a basic system for modeling is invaluable, and will not likely ever be outdated, just updated.  The book does much better at teaching data visualization than modeling.  Not limited to ggplot2, tidyverse, and modelr but certainly heavy in them."
67,The book is great and very relevant. Easy to read (if familiar with stats).,"I am well-versed in multivariate statistics and found this text to be extremely helpful building on what I already know in R. I still have some statistical questions that I would like explained more, but I think that is for another book; this is to say, this book does not cover statistical analysis, but rather data mining, cleaning, and visualization. This is a great addition to a library and very very helpful for someone relatively new to R, but familiar with statistical programming in general. You will need more than this to work multi-level/multivariate statistics in R, but this is a useful start for a data scientist in any field."
68,Essenziale,"Indubbiamente il miglior libro introduttivo sull’analisi dei dati con R. Come è ovvio, è totalmente incentrato sul tidyverse. Ben organizzato, costruisce un ottimo percorso di apprendimento e stimola ad andare oltre. Come molti altri libri di questo gruppo è disponibile in una versione online gratuita, ma è sempre carino avere qualcosa da annotare (e da leggere su un’isola deserta)."
69,This book is easily one of the best resources for mastering R,"When I started my job as a research assistant, I started learning statistics to fill a niche. Later that introduced me into the R programming language. I've taken many free online classes, looked at videos, and worked through Github examples. This book(and the Wiley Series in general) have been the greatest resource I have used in developing R mastery.  The structure of the book is unique and very well planned, the information is still every relevant, and you will be referring to themes and concepts from this book for the rest of your career in Data Science. If you are on the fence, I highly recommend this book."
70,The go-to-book for beginner or intermediate-level user of R for data analysis,I am a research scientist and I use R on a daily basis. I found this book very useful to improve my R coding skills. I think it is a must have if you are a beginner or intermediate-level user of R for data analysis. You will not regret on this investment.
71,I love love love this book!,"In my opinion, this is the best book written about using R for data analysis! Very easy to read and follow, even some bit entertaining.There is some typos and errors in the book, like the wrong graph in the wrong place or typos. But you can look at the online electronic version of the book, it is the most updated and corrected. And it's free! Also, the author provided answer keys for the exercises. Just google it, you will find it. It helps you to compare your answer to the author's and learn more!In summary, I love love love this book! I now know why Hadley Wickham is famous for a reason."
72,Good for visualising data,"Great book. Step by step. The only thing I dislike is that there is no information about how to do descriptive statistics like summary tabs, frequencies tabs and so on. May be good if you only want to visualise the data through graphics, but not really relevant in my field (economics)."
73,Muy buen libro,Muy bueno el libro
74,The new bible for R,"Hadley Wickham transformed how we use R and accelerated its capabilities by a large margin. His work has been condensed into a single package called ""tidyverse"" which introduces tools that range from data transformation to data presentation. While his new book R for Data Science is written for beginners, even experienced users will find many resources that will make them better at R. This is because (clumsy) base packages are rarely used.If you use R, you must have read this book, no matter how experienced you are!"
75,Good book for a Data Science class,"I really like this book.  Like all R books, if you are a beginner, its hard to find a particular concept.  Googling the question is quicker.  But, it is a great logical tutorial.  I recommend it.  I have to confess I have only worked through the first six chapters.  I think this would be a good book for a class in Data Science.The one thing I don't like, (which is not the author's fault), is that you cannot cut and paste the code into R.  Or at least I don't know how.  The Kindle people could and should make this happen."
76,A vital resource for anyone who uses R,"I've been using R for at least 10 years, but I only recently began to explore the tidyverse. I bought this book as a guide to help me learn more about the tidyverse, which I did, but I also learned a lot more. Not only did I pick up some ggplot() tricks I didn't know, I learned even more about R notebooks and a workflow in R. If you use R seriously, you should read this book and keep a copy handy to refer to."
77,A good title to start with data science in r,"This is a good book to start with data science in r. It uses the tidyverse to show how to manipulate data in R, and how to do an Exploratory Data Analysis, helpful to get familiar with the data we are analyzing. I would recommend it to everyone that need an introduction to R and Data Science or just for a reference book."
78,Broad coverage of R data analysis tools,"The authors are mercifully brief in their explanations but generous in the code samples supplied.  They focus on important details but don't get bogged down in minutia, giving excellent references to on-line material for additional information.  I am still in the process of reading the text, but so far the coverage has been excellent.  I am new to the R code base, so this book is a treasure trove.  The print quality of the book is also refreshingly high, with carefully chosen fonts and effective  use of color."
79,Easy to learn from!,"I really enjoy learning from this book. It has an easy to follow conversational tone, and yet is packed with insights. I like that it contains reproducible code for the examples, so it’s easy to practice from. I do wish the end of section problems had answers in the back.This book is available to read online for free from Hadley’s website (easily found in a google search).  There are a few errors in this printed copy (just a few), but the one on his website has the corrections."
80,Good content - Poorly Printed,"The content of this book is useful, but is freely available online.  I prefer to read/work from print, so I purchased this book.  The book is small, printed in small font, and bound tightly so that it will not stay open to a page.  This made it a poor physical workbook in my hands  - especially as you try to type, and so I opted to continue to use the online version.  Bummer."
81,Easily the best book for learning R,"This is an excellent book for beginners, and teaches R in a consistent and fun way. Especially appreciate Hadley's ""tidyverse"" approach which makes things easier for beginners, since R can be a mess of inconsistency and mystery otherwise. The book is not so good as a reference however, as there is no summary of each chapter where you can quickly remind yourself of the commands. The book is available free online, so check it out there to see if this is what you need."
82,An essential book for data scientists,An online free version is available and has been continuously updated by the authors... but for people who like having a physical copy this book is really worth it. An essential book for data scientists
83,Great book if you're learning the capabilities or R,"I wouldn't say this qualifies as a beginner 'R' book, although I'm not sure if it's even advertised as being one. I was recommended this book after taking a college course in which we utilized the software, so I could had good foundation that made it easier to jump into it without any problems. This book contains an impressive amount of useful material, capabilities that you weren't even aware that 'R' was capable of, especially as a beginner-intermediate user of R."
84,The book is basically a college text,"The book is a college text.  It has exercises throughout each chapter that have you working issues and problems not previously explained.  And like a lot college texts, it has poor examples, examples that don't exist, examples that are not explained, and examples that are just plain wrong (can any of you remember those days with Calculus books? lol)It's not a beginners book, nor is it a reference.  To me it doesn't follow any learning patters for the language, like beginning with constructs and objects, how to setup R on your workstation, how to setup an R server, nor even syntax.  He jumps right in with a ton of graphics code with little explanation of the code itself.On the good side, it *is* an Oreilly book, and if you have patience beyond any normal measures it may be handy here and there.  Some things not explained elsewhere (other books, web) may be worked here."
85,"Good content, Bad Quality",Content is great. Quality of book is horrible. Pages are falling out.
86,Excellent primer for long time SAS user,"Made me realize how powerful that my old friend SAS is, and how easy it is to use R to perform the same data manipulations. The book has brief chapters filled with examples of each functional group. Not sure if the book would be as good for student or new comer who does not realize that tools like SAS and/or R are such necessary and powerful tools if they are not willing to climb steep learning curves to achieve the required end."
87,Intended for beginners but useful even for experienced,"The book is intended for a reader, that is not experienced in data science. As an experienced data scientist, that just needed to learn R syntax better, the book was unnecessarily verbose for me and sometimes it was really painful to read many pages explaining obvious. Nevertheless it was a well spend time, because:- There is usually more than one way to do given task in R. The book describes packages/commands that are generally considered to be the best/standard procedures.- The book describes best practices (coding style etc.) that are really beneficial.- The print quality is very high (nice paper, colorful graphs and even frequent code snippets are printed with colorful syntax highlighting)."
88,confusing,"I picked this up to try and help me learn Program R, as I am a neophyte. I have some limited R experience,  this was way over my head, and seemed hard to understand. I have since purchased R for Beginners, and R for Dummies, and hope to  tackle this book  again with a bit more introductory material under my belt."
89,I have bought other books on R and Python programming which I found boring and very dry,"Finally a book on programming that does not bore me to death. I have bought other books on R and Python programming which I found boring and very dry. This is not like those books. It is entertaining, I read some chapters in the evening on my bed and followed the exampled in my office to memorize the functions and learn how to use the methods. It is not a book on data science though, you will need a book on stats and machine learning to complete the data science package. Yet, this book will give you the tools to start straight away with R programming and with some data analysis."
90,plot examples fail on OSX,"First impressions: wow. Then... meh; disappointed that none of the plotting examples worked on OSX. Some google time later, a solution was found. Now, back to... nice! Hoping that the rest is smooth sailing. That ordeal points to the need for a support channel (Slack, mailing list, Google Group, etc) where one could send questions. None exists which explains my 1-star downvote."
91,Best R guide out there,Easy to read and follow and use as a reference as you work through your stuff.
92,"Great data wrangling intro for the novice, great recipe book for the experienced","I am a fan of the elegance and coherence of the Tidyverse. This book has proven to be an invaluable reference and recipe guide, especially when it comes to data wrangling. I'm an experienced developer and am very comfortable with R. However, I'm not always able to exercise the R muscles in my daily work. When I take on a new project, I like to quickly review the most pertinent sections of this book to re-sharpen my ""R wrangling toolbox""."
93,Balnced & Well Written,"I am truly enjoying learning r programming with this book. The tone and language are honest and empathetic to the challenges of learning. I've done my best to tackle the exercises throughout it and it has definitely given some comfort.isMy one request is for a binder style book, it's a pain to keep pages open between coding. Dear O'Reilly crew, knowing this I will be $5-10 more for that style :)"
94,Overall great book.,"Clear, workable examples with the right balance of detail."
95,"A must for statisticians, and data science practitioners","Very clear and concise. The best introduction to the Tidyverse I have read so far.If you liked the book, you will appreciate Tidy Modeling with R, by Julia Silge and Max Kuhn.Simply excellent!"
96,Great book.,"I was a bit sceptic buying a book about R having so much available on the internet. However, the book I bought was a great choice. I like the  writing style of Hadley. Lots of examples and good illustrations. I find it easy to read and practice writing R code."
97,Livro muito interessante para quem quer aprender a usar a biblioteca Tidyverse!,"O autor do livro é Hadley Wickam, criador do pacote ggplot2 (para visualização de dados, criar gráficos no R), participou da criação de outros pacotes que fazem parte da biblioteca Tidyverse, e atualmente trabalha na RStudio. Esse livro não é para quem quer aprender R do zero.  Aconselho para quem já sabe o básico e quer aprender a utilizar a biblioteca tidyverse. Muito bom, aborda como criar gráficos, como ""arrumar"" as bases de dados, como criar relatórios dinâmicos e muito mais. Hadley apresenta diversos exemplos que podem ser reproduzidos pelo leitor utilizando a base de dados ""mtcars"", que já vem disponível no R."
98,Required item for data scientist's book shelf,Pulls together a number of subjects in the practice of data science using R.  Can be read in a comfortable chair or while working on a project.  Paper edition is much better in the comfortable chair!Each chapter addresses a key area of applied data science and introduces an associated R package.  Several of these areas are revolutionizing how we manage data and report in a reproducible fashion.  In a few years we will wonder how we got things done without this!
99,I think it's always easy to criticize what is missing from a book like ...,"I think it's always easy to criticize what is missing from a book like this, but after reading a couple others, I found this to be good for my needs. I was taking an online course created by some Johns Hopkins analysts, and I spent so much time listening to their lectures and finding so much was missing it began to be a waste of time. This book was exactly what I needed to fill in many gaps, have some meaningful but not complicated practice, etc..."
100,"If you're new to R or programming, do not buy this book","This book is intended as an introduction to the tidyverse package in R, and not as an introduction to the language or statistical analysis as a whole. For someone who wants to start learning R from scratch, would not recommend this book. Furthermore, the exercises contains questions with solutions that were never actually taught in the text. One has to go online to search for the answers to find out."
101,Un básico,"Muy muy bueno.Hasta donde he llegado me parece un muy buen libro para comenzar en R en la ciencia de datos, no esperen técnicas de ML ni estadística compleja  puesto que se trata de un libro con las tareas previas a la modelización. Básicamente tratamiento de bases de datos,visualización y exploratoria es lo que cubre."
102,Great reference for code,"Great product to begin learning more about R (I used Rstudio ide). Cleaning, preprocessing data, and machine learning for R, visualization of data. Great reference and resource to have on the shelf."
103,Great Starter and Advanced R learning,"Book arrived in great condition. I learned so much R programming for data science. It's useful for self-studying rather than from some online courses; or even very good for learning in conjunction with taking courses.I highly recommend this book. The material is easy to understand, designed from basics to more advanced. Build up your skills with R pretty easily."
104,Great Book for Beginning R Users,"This book was recommended to me by an R instructor at my university. Even after reading through just a bit of it, it seems extremely straightforward and like it's going to be great at explaining data science and beginning programming which is great since I am just starting with programming of any sort. I am hoping to use some of the techniques in this book for my Ph.D. research. Great book!"
105,Analisi dati con Tidyverse,"Veramente un bel libro introduttivo all'ambiente Tidyverse pensato e sviluppato dall'autore in R.A mio avviso è necessaria una preparazione di base ad R per comprendere un minimo le nozioni dei vari argomenti trattati.Se il vostro obiettivo è fare analisi dati, in maniera elegante e produttiva, non andate oltre, studiatevi questo libro.Ogni capitolo presenta gradualmente un nuovo argomento, con tanti esempi a supporto. Alla fine dell vostra lettura avrete una visione di massima sui pacchetti R per fare analisi dati, sulle loro possibilità e sintassi."
106,"The book, being written by the celebrity of the R community, is really inspirational.","I have done several online R courses before I decided to purchase this book. The book, being written by the celebrity of the R community, is really inspirational. It was a good summary for some of the courses that I did online. I am halfway through reading the book. In simple language, the author nicely guided me in learning R. Interested in learning R? I definitely recommend you buying this book."
107,Perfect book for people who want to start learning data ...,Perfect book for people who want to start learning data science. There are some typos like picture diagrams not related to the code but overall helpful with lots of exercises.
108,Book on R,"Is book on R, sort of what you expect when ordering a book on R"
109,Fantastic book on R and data analysis in general,"If you are learning R or want to get a better understanding of the language, I can't recommend this book highly enough. Packed full of information and written very well.Bought two copies, first one when I was trying to fill in some of my knowledge gaps about R. Then bought another copy for other analysts in my team to use. We all write better code now :-)"
110,Great intro to Tidyverse R,This the Bible of the Tidyverse in R. If you have been trying to pick up R but haven't found a proper foothold yet. This book is the best next step for you. Of note this book is also available for free online r4ds
111,vbmvbmvm,vvbmvbmvbm
112,"Not a very good tool for beginners, perhaps a good reference manual","2 problems.  First, solutions to the exercises are not given in the book as others have stated here.  I managed to find solutions online.  Idea: if author is not motivated to include this, why not document where this can be found online?  Second, the exercises ask you to solve problems using commands before said commands are introduced.  Perhaps the positive reviews are from folks using this as a reference manual rather than learning from scratch.  Because it is not really useful as a learning tool for beginners."
113,I've found this book an excellent resource for taking a step back to fill in ...,I bought this book after enrolling on a Data Science course that dived straight into R Programming without first giving a solid grounding in R basics. I've found this book an excellent resource for taking a step back to fill in the necessary gaps to enable me to progress. The sequencing of the book makes perfect sense since you get to put together some quick visual examples first that encourage you to keep at it before going a bit deeper and learning programming concepts. Highly recommended.
114,A user friendly guide to R,It is an excellent book. Starts with data visualization and demonstrates the power and elegance of R without getting the reader bogged down in the rigmaroles of coding. I am still reading and doing the exercises given in each chapter. I am looking forward to reading more and learning more about this awesome language.
115,Easy to learn,"This book made learning R very easy! It gives you step by step instructions and has images to guide you  along. I used it in part of my thesis, and it truly is amazing!"
116,A nice book,"A very nice book on the subject,the think i loved is that the writer makes clear that not all things can be covered on one book and also provides external resources on some of the need to know subjects.It is well writen and as a person who had no expirience on the subject (i do now!)I would suggest the book to anyone who wants to take look on R for Data Science."
117,Great introduction and reference for Data Scientists,"Best book on the market for R programmers. Starts with the basics and methodically progresses to advanced topics, so beginners and advanced users can profit from using this book. I read it from cover to cover when I received it and still refer to it frequently.I am looking forward to their next book."
118,Great,"Nicely organized, color coded text, color figures, and a great tutorial on tidyverse/how to be introduced to R. Lots of solutions can also be found online in similar formats to hadleys site. Bought a copy for myself and will buy another for my lab when I leave."
119,"The Datacamp Course, on paper",This is a great book to reinforce all the basic R knowledge you need to create great data proyects. The book uses libraries available from the DSLABS and other CRAN sources and covers all fundamentals to be able to use R Studio proficiently.
120,Greate Book,The book will teach you how to do the analyst data.
121,Good book makes you motivated to read,"I love this book and is learning R systematically with the very-detailed guidance. I usually don’t buy books, but this time I feel worthy. Strongly recommend to somebody who hopes to arm themselves with abilities and knowledge."
122,Good for learning different ways to do same thing in R,Perfect for diving deep into the R language besides exploring over the internet
123,Good Format,"Love that there are so many examples, makes it easy to self teach although I use this for a CS class."
124,As described,Shipping was very fast. Product was exactly as described.
125,"R code heavy, but walks you through it",Talks about not only coding but what a data scientist is responsible for in a team and how to workflow through the project. Also very technical about r and it’s capabilities.
126,Essentiell,"Eines der Standardwerke, die man als R-Professional gelesen und durchgearbeitet haben sollte. Schwerpunkt ist die Arbeit als Data-Scientist mit R und dem Tidyverse-Package und den vielen darin enthaltenen Packages wie dyplr, readr, modelr, lubridate etc.Das Buch ist vom Autor auch online verfügbar gemacht worden, leider darf ich hier keinen Link posten, also googlen! Dort findet sich immer die aktuelle Version, aus der heraus die Printversion erstellt wird. Aber zum Arbeiten ist das gedruckte Werk natürlich besser zu gebrauchen."
127,For uni,I needed this for my university study as it was suggested by my professor. It has many examples of the commands I need to use. So has been very useful.
128,Great for beginners and to refresh the tidyverse in R,"Great book to start to learn R! The first chapter focuses on visualization and you'll be able to write some code for scatterplits, bar charts and more within the first 20 minutes. I love the training excercises. Some are easy, some are hard and challenging."
129,the book is great!,for those that want to learn R this is a good book. Very detailed.
130,"Written by the master himself, it's a no-brainer.",Introduces the concepts of the tidyverse in a way that makes them intuitive and easy to implement. I would say you need some base level of experience in R or other languages but not much - the tidyverse is a great place to start for beginners.Worth noting that the book is made available for free online but is beautifully reproduced in book form for ease of reference.
131,"Excellent introduction to the ""tidy"" approach to use R","Excellent introduction to the ""tidy"" approach to use R.  It has bundled several R packages and created a user interface to R and particularly RStudio that makes is much easier to use R for statistics, graphing, and data and text mining.  Strongly recommend new R users to adopt this approach."
132,Excellent book for beginners,Excellent book for beginners. The fundamentals provided here were good enough for me write quite a few tools at work. I have since ventured into machine learning and AI but I still find myself referencing this book every now and then. Highly recommended
133,Super recomendado!,"O livro é excelente. Com uma abordagem aplicada e bem didática, os autores apresentam o universo do tidyverse de forma bastante descomplicada. O tidyverse, por sua vez, é um pacote de ferramentas incríveis, que nos possibilitam fazer muito do trabalho de um cientista de dados com poucas linhas de código e de forma bastante intuitiva. Ao final de cada capítulo há uma lista de exercícios para testar os conhecimentos adquiridos, embora o nível de dificuldade exija do leitor algum conhecimento prévio (básico) de programação em R (e, sobretudo, de lógica de programação). Super recomendo a compra!"
134,"if you want to learn R with a book, get this one","learning on internet is definitely easier and better, but if you need a reference book, this is as good as any"
135,Good book about ggplot2 package,It is a very good book about ggplot2! Already recommended my several friends to buy it.  — A stat major grad studnet
136,What a great book,"I am an architect that got into studying data analysis as kind of a weird mid-life crisis. After some Coursera classes and a few books, I am really starting to finally understand R.  But, this books and the Tidyverse set of packages is a game changer. So much more clear and intuitive. I highly recommend this book!  Buy it."
137,Great book. Hadley Wickham is arguably the most important ...,"Great book. Hadley Wickham is arguably the most important single person in data science in the past 10+ years ... I would make that case ... and this book shows you how to use the dead-on tools he's built, with a singular focus on what's necessary and useful for data manipulation and visualization."
138,Literally changed my life - this is an amazing book!,"This book literally changed my life as it caused me to realize that data science is my calling.  The writing is lucid, the examples are instructive, and the tools the book teaches border on magical.  I can't recommend this book highly enough!"
139,"it puts my knowledge in much better context, helps me understand _why_ the tidyverse does ...","As a practicing R user, I am familiar with many of the things in this book.  That said, it puts my knowledge in much better context, helps me understand _why_ the tidyverse does things the way it does, and taught me multiple new tips and tricks."
140,Good book,"Still reading but it’s good. R is tough and so vast with its ecosystem of packages. One of the most important packages is tidyverse and this is used in the book. To master R you’ll need a lot of patience and you’ll be frustrated in the beginning. But all good things in life require sweat, persistence and hard work."
141,Great book by O'Reilly,"Great book and as always, the O'Reilly series is great.  I'm using this for a Data Science program that I am enrolled in and it is actually recommended by the university."
142,Recommended,"Good intro, well written with helpful examples"
143,Excellent book. After watching R YouTube videos (Roger Peng,"Excellent book. After watching R YouTube videos (Roger Peng, Google Developers) the book brings it all together and shows so much more. Amazing resource to learn R. I could be wrong but the book is more detailed than the online version, but very grateful to have a digital resource as well."
144,Great,Great
145,One of my best book purchases so far,One of my best book purchases so far. I was so excited by author’s style that I finished the book in a week!!Definitely a must have if you are looking for r programming!
146,A great introduction to the Tidyverse,A great introduction to the Tidyverse. Coming from SAS programming with only a little R experience this provided a good introduction to me to using R and the Tidyverse in a consistent manner that is focused on getting you programming and giving you useful tools.
147,Excellent condition,As promised.
148,concise and to the task,"A MUST. If you do any kind of work with R this book is great. Concise and to the task, from wrangling data to plots, every step is covered and is a good base for more advanced techniques"
149,"Gets an ""A+"" in Teaching Data Visualization in R","If you want to get started in R and learn about cleaning, wrangling and visualizing the data, get this book. Recommended."
150,Great resource,"Perfect condition! Great book- easy to read, and well organized."
151,State of the Art des Datenjudo mit R,"Hadley Wickham zeigt einmal mehr, dass er einer der führenden R-Köpfe ist. Alle Aspekte der Datenanalyse werden angesprochen oder besser gesagt alle Schritte. Vom Einlesen, über Aufbereiten, Visualisieren, Modellieren und Berichten. Das Modellieren wird allerdings nur kurz abgehandelt. Kein Vergleich zu Klassikern wie Hastie o.ä.Sein ""tidyverse""-Ansatz wird konsequent durchgezogen. Elegant und mächtig. Einfach geschrieben. Kaum Mathe - die theoretischen Hintergründe der Datenanalyse sind nicht Gegenstand des Buches."
152,but I still enjoy the physical copy,"It's free on the INTERNET, but I still enjoy the physical copy.  It's very accessible and wouldn't be a bad book for beginners who want to learn the language without the stats."
153,"Exemplos que consolidam conhecimentos, Um livro para os que desejam crescer em suas habilidades de análise no R.","Gostei do livro, inclui uma abordagem interessante que ajuda na compreensão e aprendizado do uso do R como ferramenta de análise. Através de exemplos torna o aprendizado mais fácil, porém em minha opinião é preciso uma certa familiaridade com o uso do software e também das técnicas envolvidas na análise o que não chega a ser problema pois entendo que essas devem ser características daqueles que irão se interessar pelo livro. Se você é da área e lida bem com o R eu recomendo o livro, certamente irá enriquecer suas habilidades e ajudar em futuros trabalhos."
154,Gives bascis of the R programming,It explains R programming in easy and simplest way for the beginners. For intermediate users it is not a best suggestion.
155,Good book,Arrived the next day and was in great condition! Exactly what I expected! Thanks

163,Well written and useful,Really good book and well written. I'm already familiar with R programming so always great to learn more and more !
164,"Statisticians are supposed to be sticklers for detail, so ...","Statisticians are supposed to be sticklers for detail, so it is disappointing to find multiple errors on every page.  The extremely narrow focus on ggplot2 and a package called 'tidyverse' also limits the utility of this book for teaching. The title is not a fair indication of content."
165,Not the Best for Beginners,"Not perfect for beginner. The best parts are in the exercises, with no direct answer. I had to look through the internet myself for the solutions. Still a good book, but probably wouldn't recommend if you want to get the gist of R asap."
166,Amazing!,Amazing! Clinician working in research and this has transformed what I can do with data.Perfect as a beginner.
167,Needs more specif examples to understand,Explanations without enough examples to make the description concrete.
168,Excelente libro para utilizar y profundizar en el uso del paquete tidyverse,"Hadely Wickam, autor de ambos la colección de paquetes incluídos en tidyverse y el libro, hace un excelente trabajo en explicar el uso de los mismos desde un nivel principiante a un nivel avanzado. El libro incluye muchos ejemplos y ejercicios que clarifican mucho el uso que se puede hacer de las distintas funciones contenidas en esos paquetes de R."
